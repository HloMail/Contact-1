## Bootstrap Advantages

1. **Responsive Grid System**: Bootstrap's grid system ensures that the page layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
2. **Pre-styled Components**: The framework provides pre-styled form controls, buttons, and other components, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different pages and components.
3. **Customizable**: Bootstrap's styles can be easily overridden or extended to create a unique design that aligns with the brand's identity.
4. **Extensive Documentation**: The framework is well-documented, making it easier for developers to implement and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
5. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Bootstrap's codebase is optimized for cross-browser compatibility, ensuring that the page renders correctly across different web browsers.

2. **Contact Form**:
  - Full Name input: Allows users to provide their full name.
  - Email input with icon: Enables users to enter their email address, with a subtle icon for visual enhancement.
  - Message textarea: Provides a larger text area for users to write their message or inquiry.

## Customization

The contact page utilizes custom CSS for the underline effect on the headings and Bootstrap for the overall styling and layout. To customize the page, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `.contact-form h1` and `.contact-form h2` classes in the `<style>` tag to adjust the heading styles, including font size, color, and underline effect.
2. Update the Bootstrap classes used on the HTML elements to change the layout or styling of various components, such as the form inputs, buttons, or container dimensions.
3. Adjust the `<form>` element by modifying the `action` attribute to specify the desired URL or backend logic for form submission.
